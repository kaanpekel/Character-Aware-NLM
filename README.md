# Character-Aware-NLM
Character-Aware Neural Language Models

The project is about a simple neural language model that relies only on character level inputs. The outputs are word level.

The model uses a CNN and a highway network over characters and the output of those are given to RNN as input.

The model outperforms word-level predictions and thus with fewer parameters.
